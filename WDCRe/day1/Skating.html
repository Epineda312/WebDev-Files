            Skateboarding is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_sport">action sport</a> originating
            in the
            United States that involves riding and performing
            tricks using a skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an art form, an entertainment industry
            job,
            and a method of transportation.[1][2] Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders
            throughout the years. A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8
            billion
            in annual revenue, with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world.[3] In 2016, it was announced
            that
            skateboarding will be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, for both male and female teams

        <h2>1970's</h2>
        <p>
            In the early 1970s, Frank Nasworthy started to develop a skateboard wheel made of polyurethane, calling
            his
            company
            Cadillac Wheels.[8] Prior to this new material, skateboards wheels were metal or "clay" wheels.[1] The
            improvement
            in traction and performance was so immense that from the wheel's release in 1972 the popularity of
            skateboarding
            started to rise rapidly again, causing companies to invest more in product development. Nasworthy
            commissioned
            artist Jim Evans to do a series of paintings promoting Cadillac Wheels, they were featured as ads and
            posters in
            the
            resurrected Skateboarder Magazine, and proved immensely popular in promoting the new style of
            skateboarding.
        </p>

        <h2>1980's</h2>
        <p>
            This period was fueled by skateboard companies that were run by skateboarders. The focus was initially
            on vert
            ramp
            skateboarding. The invention of the no-hands aerial (later known as the ollie) by Alan Gelfand in
            Florida in
            1976,[39]
            and the almost parallel development of the grabbed aerial by George Orton and Tony Alva in California,
            made it
            possible
            for skaters to perform airs on vertical ramps. While this wave of skateboarding was sparked by
            commercialized
            vert
            ramp
            skating, a majority of people who skateboarded during this period did not ride vert ramps. As most
            people could
            not
            afford to build vert ramps, or did not have access to nearby ramps, street skating increased in
            popularity.

        <h2>1990's</h2>
        Skateboarding during the 1990s became dominated by street skateboarding.[1] Most boards are about 7+1‚ÅÑ4
        to 8 inches
        (180
        to 200 mm) wide and 30 to 32 inches (760 to 810 mm) long. The wheels are made of an extremely hard
        polyurethane,
        with
        hardness (durometer) approximately 99A. The wheel sizes are relatively small so that the boards are
        lighter, and the
        wheels' inertia is overcome quicker, thus making tricks more manageable. Board styles have changed
        dramatically
        since
        the 1970s but have remained mostly alike since the mid-1990s. The contemporary shape of the skateboard
        is derived
        from
        the freestyle boards of the 1980s with a largely symmetrical shape and relatively narrow width. This
        form had become
        standard by the mid-1990s
